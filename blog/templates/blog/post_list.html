    <h1>Rona Plant</h1>
        <h2>Msci Environmental Geology with a Year in Computer Science</h2>
    <body>
        <p>Current MSci student graduating in Summer 2021 <br>
          During my time at university I have undertaken a <br>
          variation of modules including topics in hydrogeology, <br>
          engineering geology, environmental pollution and <br>
          sedimentology, as well as field skills development <br>
          involving residentials in Northern Scotland, South-West <br>
          England and Southern Spain. I have a keen interest in the <br>
          environmental sector, thus have developed my skills and <br>
          knowledge accordingly. I have completed various projects <br>
          taking advantage of my competent IT skills using specialised <br>
          software including ArcGIS, Groundwater Vistas and SPSS. <br>
          This led me to conduct environmental surveys and study soil <br>
          samples as a major element of my dissertation.</p>
        <p>It actually works, hurray</p>
